<strong>Abstract:</strong>
<p>
A method for constructing non-uniform filter banks is presented. Starting from a uniform system of
translates, generated by a prototype filter, a non-uniform covering of the frequency axis is obtained
by composition with a warping function. The warping function is a C^1 -diffeomorphism that deter-
mines the frequency progression and can be chosen freely, apart from minor technical restrictions.
The resulting functions are interpreted as filter frequency responses and, combined with
appropriately chosen decimation factors, give rise to a non-uniform analysis filter bank. Classical Gabor and
wavelet filter banks are obtained as special cases. Beyond the state-of-the-art, we construct a filter
bank adapted to a frequency scale derived from human auditory perception and families of filter
banks that can be interpreted as an interpolation between linear (Gabor) and logarithmic (wavelet)
frequency scales. For any arbitrary warping function, we derive straightforward decay conditions
on the prototype filter and bounds for the decimation factors, such that the resulting warped filter
bank forms a frame. In particular, we obtain a simple and constructive method for obtaining tight
frames with bandlimited filters by invoking previous results on generalized shift-invariant systems.
